# Romeovs's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

I use [homerun](https://github.com/romeovs/homerun) to keep everything under
`~/.config` instead of placing it in `~` directly.

# hidden files

Some files contain private content and cannot be saved to git.
You need to manually copy them.  These are the files:
- `ssh/id_rsa`
- `zsh/private`
